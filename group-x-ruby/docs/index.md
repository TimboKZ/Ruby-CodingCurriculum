# Introduction

This is a documentation on learning programming with Ruby created for Coding Curriculum project at University College London.

## Quick word about the authors

Hello there, we are Ashley, Zac, Artem and Tim and we study Computer Science at a fine institution known as [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/). Making this project was a part of our ENGS102P Design and Professional Skills module and we tried our best to come up with something interesting for you. We hope you're going to enjoy every single part of this tutorial.

## Why is programming important?

Since the turn of the 21st century, computers have been introduced and become a very vital part of our lives. Not all computers look the same, they can be gigantic supercomputers that cost billions and as small as your smartphone which is also a very powerful computer that you can operate in the comfort of your palm.
Computers don't just magically transform electricity and your interaction into solutions and display the content to us - the users, they require software created by programmers.

Â§A software or program is a set of instructions for the computer to perform a specific task. There are many different ways the same instructions can be written, they are called programming languages and one of the easiest one to learn is Ruby. For example, we want to display the classic phrase "Hello World!" in Ruby we type:

    puts "Hello World!"



## Our language of choice: Ruby
