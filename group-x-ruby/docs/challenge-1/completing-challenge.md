# Completing challenge 1

In this part of the tutorial, you would learn how to complete a task that you have completed earlier, using new found skills so that
the code is easier to read, can be easily adapted and so it doesnt take so many lines of code.

##Putting everything together

Now ok, you have your new knowledge and you might want to apply it to something new, however if you try completing your first challenge with the new skills, you may find that it will be far easier to write and adapt.
