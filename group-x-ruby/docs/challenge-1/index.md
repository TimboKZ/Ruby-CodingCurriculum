# Outline
  
Your first challenge involves the creation of a simple quiz game. Do not worry, we're not going to jump into the complicated stuff straight away - first, we will introduce basic concepts behind programming in Ruby and only then will we guide you through the process of creating a game.

This tutorial is split into 2 parts:

* First, you will learn the very basics and make a very simple quiz game using the knowledge you've acquired so far.
* In the second part we will introduce you to some

## Prerequisites:
  
* Although you don't need any prior programming experience to complete challenge #1, having some would make the learning process easier
* Installed and configured Ruby environment
* A topic to focus your quiz game on
* Lots of enthusiasm!
 
## What you will learn in this tutorial:
 
* Working with types and variables
* Working with loops, if statements and understand how does the scope in Ruby work
* Understanding hashes and arrays
* Getting user input
* Working with objects and their methods

Good luck!
