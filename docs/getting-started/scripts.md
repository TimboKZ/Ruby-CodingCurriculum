# Running Ruby Scripts

###Why use text editors?

Text editors allow you to write code  which is automatically highlighted. As you write more and more complicated programs it may become difficult to navigate through the code of the same colour so similar features are highlighted to point out certain bits of code.

Another feature of text editors is that they might help you complete a few bits of code and may point out spelling mistakes.

## Using a text editor

There are many text editors that you could use, however for the sake of this exercise I recommend using **Sublime Text**.

Dowload Sublime Text by following this link: [https://www.sublimetext.com](https://www.sublimetext.com "sublime text")

Once downloaded open and install the program.

Here is a list of some other text editors that you could use.

* **Notepad** (windows)
* **Notepad++**
* **Atom**
* **EMACS**
* **VIM**

## Writing and saving your first script

* Open Sublime Text
* Write the following code

 
    <span style="color:blue">puts</span> <span style="color:orange">'Hello, world!'</span>  
	<span style="color:blue">gets</span>


* Save the file by going to file then save
* Save the file as *something*.rb

## Running the scrip

* press the **windows+r** key

##Output

You should now have "**Hello, world**" displayed in the terminal, if not ruby isn`t installed correctly on your system. Go back to the installation page to see how to install ruby.

Press enter to close the program, this will allow you to type in commands again. Well done, you now know how to launch ruby scripts!!!
